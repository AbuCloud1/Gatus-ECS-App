## Infrastructure Components

### VPC & Networking
- **VPC CIDR**: 10.0.0.0/16 with multi-AZ deployment
- **Public Subnets**: 10.0.1.0/24 (eu-west-1a), 10.0.2.0/24 (eu-west-1b)
- **Private Subnets**: 10.0.3.0/24 (eu-west-1a), 10.0.4.0/24 (eu-west-1b)
- **Internet Gateway**: Public internet access
- **NAT Gateways**: Private subnet internet access with high availability

### Load Balancer & SSL
- **Application Load Balancer**: HTTPS termination on port 443
- **SSL Certificate**: ACM-managed with automatic renewal
- **HTTP Redirect**: Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection
- **Health Checks**: Application endpoint monitoring on /health

### Container Orchestration
- **ECS Cluster**: Fargate launch type for serverless management
- **Task Definition**: CPU 256, Memory 512MB with resource constraints
- **Service Configuration**: Auto-scaling with desired count management

### Security Implementation
- **Security Groups**: Separate groups for ALB and ECS tasks
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access with execution roles
- **Network Isolation**: Private subnets for application workloads
- **SSL/TLS**: End-to-end encryption with certificate management (ACM)

## Environment Strategy

### Multi-Environment Deployment & Environment Isolation
- **Environment Isolation Development**: Development, Staging and Production environment
- **Separate State Files**: Each environment maintains independent Terraform state
- **Consistent Infrastructure**: Identical components with environment-specific variables
- **Promotion Workflow**: Infrastructure changes progress through environments
- **State locking**: Prevents others from acquiring the lock and potentially corrupting state

## CI/CD & Automation

### GitHub Actions Pipeline
- **Terraform Validation**: Syntax and configuration validation
- **Security Scanning**: Checkov integration for security best practices
- **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks for formatting and validation
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Validation before deployment

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **Terraform Formatting**: Automatic code formatting
- **Security Validation**: Checkov security scanning
- **Code Quality**: YAML validation and whitespace checking

### Deployment Automation
- **Current State**: Manual deployment with deployment scripts
- **Target State**: Fully automated CI/CD pipeline
- **Expected Improvement**: 87% reduction in deployment time (15min → 2min)

## 🐳 Custom Gatus Build

### Build from Source
Instead of using pre-built Docker images, this project builds Gatus **completely from source code**:

- **`garus-app/source/`** - Complete Gatus Go source code
- **Custom Dockerfile** - Multi-stage build process
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated build and deployment pipeline
- **Full Control** - Modify any part of the application

### Automated Build Pipeline
- **Triggers**: Push to main, PRs, or manual dispatch
- **Builds**: Gatus from Go source code
- **Tags**: `latest` + timestamp for versioning
- **Deploys**: Automatically pushes to ECR
- **Tests**: Verifies build and image contents

### Customization Capabilities
- **Monitoring Logic** - Modify watchdog and alerting
- **API Endpoints** - Add custom REST endpoints
- **Frontend UI** - Customize dashboard appearance
- **Configuration** - Extend monitoring options

## Security and Compliance

### Network Security
- **VPC Isolation**: Private subnets for application workloads
- **Security Groups**: Layer 3-4 security with port restrictions
- **SSL/TLS**: End-to-end encryption with certificate management

### Access Control
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for ECS tasks
- **Security Groups**: Network-level access control
- **Certificate Management**: Automated SSL certificate renewal

### Compliance Features
- **Audit Logging**: Infrastructure change tracking
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security validation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive security and deployment documentation

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

**Infrastructure Architecture**:  
I went with Multi-AZ for better uptime and DR even though it costs more. Public and private subnets were set up for security, but it did add complexity and extra NAT costs. ECS Fargate was picked to avoid managing servers and speed up delivery, at the cost of losing some low-level control.

**Security and Compliance**:  
SSL ends at the load balancer which makes cert management easier but means traffic inside isn’t encrypted. Security Groups are more complex but give tighter network isolation. The VPC runs on a custom CIDR across multiple AZs to keep it production-ready and easy to grow later.

**Operational Considerations**:  
Deployments are manual for now to keep oversight over speed. Docker builds are basic to keep things moving quickly, though they’re not yet optimized.

## Future Improvements

There are several enhancements that can be made to the project over time to improve scalability, security, maintainability, and overall performance.

**CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**:  
Automate Docker builds, pushes, and Terraform runs. Add approvals for prod releases and run security scans in the pipeline.

**Infrastructure Security**:  
IAM policies can be refined to ensure the principle of least privilege is consistently applied, and CloudTrail integration could provide comprehensive audit logging for compliance purposes.

**Container Optimization**:  
Use multi-stage builds to shrink images and speed builds. Add vuln scanning and caching, plus better health checks for containers.

**Monitoring and Observability**:  
Set up central logging like ELK to tie logs together. Add app performance monitoring, automated alerts, and cost tracking.

**Scalability and Resilience**:  
Add ECS auto-scaling, use blue-green or canary deploys to cut downtime, and add cross-region DR with backups and restores.
