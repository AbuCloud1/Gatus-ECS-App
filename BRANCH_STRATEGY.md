# Branch Strategy and Deployment Workflow

## Branch Structure

### Main Branch (Production)
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploys to production environment
- **Access**: Protected, requires pull request approval

### Develop Branch (Staging)
- **Branch**: `develop`
- **Purpose**: Integration and testing
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploys to dev and staging environments
- **Access**: Development team can push directly

### Feature Branches (Development)
- **Branch**: `feature/*`
- **Purpose**: Individual feature development
- **Deployment**: No automatic deployment
- **Access**: Developers create from develop branch

## Deployment Workflow

### Development Flow
1. **Feature Development**: Create feature branch from `develop`
2. **Code Review**: Merge feature branch to `develop` via pull request
3. **Staging Deployment**: `develop` branch auto-deploys to dev and staging
4. **Testing**: Validate in staging environment
5. **Production Release**: Merge `develop` to `main` via pull request
6. **Production Deployment**: `main` branch auto-deploys to production

### Environment Mapping
- **Dev Environment**: Deploys from `develop` branch
- **Staging Environment**: Deploys from `develop` branch
- **Production Environment**: Deploys from `main` branch

### Branch Protection Rules
- **Main Branch**: Require pull request reviews
- **Develop Branch**: Allow direct pushes for development team
- **Feature Branches**: No restrictions

## Best Practices

### Code Promotion
- Always promote code through branches: `feature` → `develop` → `main`
- Never push directly to `main` branch
- Use pull requests for code reviews

### Deployment Safety
- Test in staging before production
- Use feature flags for risky changes
- Maintain rollback capabilities

### Branch Naming
- `feature/descriptive-name` for feature branches
- `hotfix/issue-description` for urgent fixes
- `release/version-number` for release preparation
